# Steps to run the app

1. Download this folder
2. Go to Cmd > cd "folder_where_your_downloaded_code"
3. dir 
### You will observer no "node_module" folder in the list from steps #3

### Let's install the "node_module"
4. npm install

### after the installation is done. check "node_module" folder is created or not?

### Lets run the app
5. ng serve --open

### If you see green compilation, browser should open with the app on http://localhost:4200

### If you see green compilation, but no browser open??
### open browser manually and run http://localhost:4200

## Note
1. Do not use "Live server" for firing the page
2. Do not close the command propmt where you fired the command "ng serve --open". Thats Angular Live Server that helps in auto compilation.
